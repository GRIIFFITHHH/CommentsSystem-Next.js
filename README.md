<h1>Next.js Comments System</h1>

<p>This is a simple demo project demonstrating a commenting system built with <strong>Next.js</strong> and <strong>Supabase</strong>. This project was created by Luis as part of a test.</p>

<h2>Live Demo</h2>
<p>You can view the live project here: <a href="https://nextjs-comments-system.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Next.js Comments System Demo</a></p>

<h2>Tools & Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Language:</strong> JavaScript (ES6)</li>
  <li><strong>Framework:</strong> Next.js (React-based)</li>
  <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Supabase Auth with Google login</li>
  <li><strong>Database:</strong> Supabase (PostgreSQL)</li>
  <li><strong>Hosting (demo):</strong> Netlify</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>
  Users can log in using Google and post comments. The comments are stored in a Supabase database, and only authenticated users can read or write comments.
</p>

<h2>How it Works</h2>
<ol>
  <li>User logs in via Google using Supabase Auth.</li>
  <li>Authenticated users can post comments through a Next.js frontend.</li>
  <li>Comments are sent to a secure API route that saves them in Supabase.</li>
</ol>

<p>This project is intended as a demo to showcase authentication, database interaction, and a commenting system using modern web technologies.</p>

<h2>Future Updates</h2>
<p>In future updates, I plan to add additional features such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Edit and delete comments</li>
  <li>Like and dislike functionality for comments</li>
  <li>Possibly real-time updates so comments appear instantly</li>
</ul>
